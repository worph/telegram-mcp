## Architecture

Bidirectional Telegram-MCP bridge: acts as both an **MCP server** (exposing Telegram tools to LLMs) and an **MCP client** (forwarding Telegram messages to a target MCP server).

### Data Flow

1. Telegram message **or inline-button tap (callback query)** → `TelegramBot` (grammY polling/webhook) → resolves `{{variable}}` templates in target params
2. `MCPClient.callTool()` forwards resolved params to the configured target MCP server
3. Target LLM processes the message, calls back via `send_message`/`edit_message`/`send_photo` tools on this server's MCP endpoint
4. `MCPServer` handles the tool call → `TelegramBot.sendMessage()` replies to the user

Both text messages and button taps go through the same `dispatchToTarget()` path. A tap is acknowledged immediately (stops the client spinner) and forwarded with the callback fields exposed as template variables — so an LLM can send buttons with `send_message`, receive the tap as a fresh forwarded call, act, and `edit_message` to lock the buttons. `perm:` permission buttons are handled separately and never forwarded.

A button can opt into `lockOnTap: true` (callbackData buttons only). On the first tap the bridge locks the message **server-side before forwarding** — `lockMessageToChoice` removes the keyboard entirely and appends a plain `✓ <chosen>` line to the message text (so the decision stays visible but nothing remains tappable), and further/duplicate taps are swallowed — so Approve/Decline prompts behave as a single click without waiting for the LLM round-trip. Lock-ness is encoded **statelessly** in the button's `callback_data`: `toInlineKeyboard` prefixes a non-printing marker (`LOCK_PREFIX`) onto lock buttons, the tap handler recognises it via `data.startsWith(LOCK_PREFIX)`, and `handleCallbackQuery` strips it again before forwarding so `{{callbackData}}` stays clean. Because the lock signal travels on the message itself, **collapse survives a bridge restart** — no send-time registry to lose. The only in-memory state is `lockedMessages` (keyed `chatId:messageId`, capped at 500), a best-effort race-guard so two near-simultaneous taps collapse exactly once; losing it on restart is harmless (the keyboard is already gone, or simply collapses again). Non-lock buttons keep the persist-until-`edit_message` behaviour for menus.

### Key Components

- **`src/index.ts`** — Entry point. Wires together bot, MCP client/server, permission services, Express API. Handles graceful shutdown and restart logic.
- **`src/bot.ts`** — grammY bot with commands (`/start`, `/new`, `/mcp`, `/revoke`). `handleTextMessage()` is fire-and-forget (not awaited) to avoid deadlock with permission callback queries. Includes MarkdownV2 escaping for replies.
- **`src/mcp-server.ts`** — Exposes tools (`send_message`, `edit_message`, `send_photo`, `ask`, `get_answer`, `echo`, `mcp_info`, `get_chat_history`) via stateless Streamable HTTP POST (`/mcp`). Each request gets its own `Server` instance. `send_message` accepts an optional `buttons` inline keyboard and returns the `messageId`; `edit_message` updates a sent message's text/buttons (omit `buttons` to strip them).
- **`src/mcp-client.ts`** — `MCPClient` connects to a target MCP server via Streamable HTTP transport (wraps transport to suppress `notifications/initialized` errors, auto-reconnects on `callTool()`, 3-minute timeout for permission prompts). `MCPClientPool` holds one `MCPClient` per target (default + each `chatTargets` entry) and `resolve(chatId)` picks the right one; the bot calls it on every incoming message/tap.
- **`src/api.ts`** — Express app factory. Mounts MCP router at `/mcp` **before** JSON middleware (MCP needs raw body). REST endpoints under `/api/` for config, status, restart, permission handling, and MCP server info.
- **`src/permission-service.ts`** — Two services: `PermissionService` (Telegram inline keyboard flow) and `WebPermissionService` (SSE-based browser flow with CSRF protection). Permission routing is based on `chatId`: empty → web, otherwise → Telegram.
- **`src/ask-service.ts`** — In-memory registry for human-in-the-loop questions (`ask`/`get_answer` tools): question lifecycle (pending → answered/expired), long-poll waiters, 24h max TTL, purge ~1h after expiry.
- **`src/template.ts`** — Recursively resolves `{{variable}}` placeholders in config params against `MessageContext`.
- **`src/types.ts`** — Zod schemas for config validation (`ConfigSchema`, `TelegramConfigSchema`, `TargetConfigSchema`) and TypeScript interfaces.
- **`src/mcp-info.ts`** — Generates Markdown-formatted MCP connection info text.
- **`web/`** — Static Web UI for runtime configuration, served at `/`.

### Configuration

`config.json` (validated by Zod schemas in `types.ts`):
- `telegram` — Bot token, mode (`polling`|`webhook`), optional `webhookUrl`, `accessMode` (`private` default | `public`), `allowedUsers` (user IDs or usernames; enforced by a grammY middleware in `bot.ts` that gates all updates, and by the startup chatId-recovery logic)
- `target` — default (catch-all) MCP client settings: transport (`http`), url, tool name, parameter mappings with `{{variable}}` templates
- `chatTargets` — optional array of per-chat target overrides. Each entry is a full `target` (its own url/tool/params/authToken/promptTemplate) plus a `chatIds: string[]` selector. `MCPClientPool.resolve(chatId)` returns the first entry whose `chatIds` lists the chat, else the catch-all `target`. Lets different chats route to different MCP servers (or the same server with different config). The Web UI edits this as a JSON array in the MCP edit form; UI saves preserve it.
- `server` — Web UI port (default 9634)

The Web UI allows editing config at runtime. `POST /api/restart` reloads config and reconnects both bot and MCP client.

### Permission Flow

Permissions arrive as plain `POST /api/permission` requests (not MCP tool calls). The flow:
1. External system (e.g., `claude-code-container`) sends permission request with `queryId`, `chatId`, `toolName`, `toolInput`
2. If `chatId` is present → Telegram inline keyboard (Allow/Deny/Always Allow); if empty → Web SSE stream
3. User decision resolves the pending HTTP response as `{ queryId, decision, timedOut }`
4. "Always Allow" persists in-memory per tool name; `/revoke` command clears the allowlist

### Ask Flow (human-in-the-loop questions)

The `ask` tool sends a ForceReply question to Telegram and returns a `questionId` immediately (optionally waiting up to 240s via `waitSeconds`). In `bot.ts`, `handleTextMessage()` checks `tryResolveFromMessage()` **before** forwarding to the target MCP: a reply targeting the question message (or, for plain messages, the oldest pending question in the chat) is consumed as the answer and acknowledged with a 👍 reaction instead of being forwarded. Clients poll `get_answer` (long-poll capped at 240s per call, so no client timeout tuning is needed) until `answered`/`expired`. Questions expire after `timeoutSeconds` (default/max 24h); answered/expired records are purged ~1h after expiry; state is in-memory and does not survive restarts.

### Important Implementation Details

- The text message handler in `bot.ts` is intentionally not awaited — it fires and forgets to prevent grammY's sequential update processing from deadlocking when a permission callback query arrives while the text handler is blocked waiting for MCP.
- `MCPServer.createRouter()` must be mounted before Express `json()` middleware because MCP transports handle their own body parsing.
- The `wrapTransport()` function in `mcp-client.ts` silently swallows errors from `notifications/initialized` to handle servers that don't support that notification.
- Environment variables: `PUBLIC_URL` for external URL resolution, `PORT` for server port override.

### Template Variables

Available in `target.params` mappings: `{{text}}`, `{{chatId}}`, `{{userId}}`, `{{username}}`, `{{firstName}}`, `{{lastName}}`, `{{messageId}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{isBot}}`, `{{languageCode}}`, `{{permissionCallbackUrl}}`

On an inline-button tap these additional variables are set (empty for normal messages); `{{text}}` is also set to the `callbackData` so `{{text}}`-based configs keep working:
- `{{callbackData}}` — the tapped button's `callbackData`
- `{{callbackQueryId}}` — Telegram callback query id
- `{{callbackMessageId}}` — message id the button was attached to (pass to `edit_message`)
- `{{callbackMessageText}}` — text of that message (carry the run-id / context here, since `callbackData` is capped at 64 bytes)
